# docs/Factory/Spec/STAGE_CONTRACTS.md — Factory Stage Contracts (v4.14)

## Version
v4.14

## Change Log
- v4.14 (2026-07-02): Added direct-source repair semantics for generated WEAK Stage A context recall reports.
- v4.13 (2026-05-19): Added SIMPLE-CODE-GATE v2 to Stage H and post-gate execution prompt contracts for Factory-controlled code-changing runs.
- v4.12 (2026-05-18): Added optional Codex Mission Goal Continuity adapter lint contract for derived `MISSION_CURSOR.json`; it does not alter core stage contracts or mission ledger authority.
- v4.11 (2026-05-09): Added Stage F verification tiers and optional `verification_manifest.yaml` for execution-enabled and Mission Mode runs.
- v4.10 (2026-04-26): Added stage-lint as a deterministic per-stage handoff/output check before advancing to the next stage.
- v4.9 (2026-04-26): Added post-I2 pack-lint validation as a deterministic evidence check before human Go or No-go review.
- v4.8 (2026-03-21): Added mandatory context-recall contracts and run-root `CONTEXT_RECALL_REPORT.md` evidence for Stage A, plus mission-root `MISSION_CONTEXT_RECALL_REPORT.md` continuity evidence for Mission Mode checkpointing.
- v4.7 (2026-03-10): Added Mission Mode pre-run `mission_lint.sh` contract with run-root `MISSION_LINT.txt` evidence, clarified that Mission Mode keeps one authored mission ledger (`MISSION_MANIFEST.md`), and aligned Stage A and Mission wrapper requirements to the mission drift hardening rules.
- v4.6 (2026-02-27): Added additive Mission Mode wrapper contract while preserving the canonical sprint `A -> I2` plus `POST_GATE` flow.
- v4.5 (2026-02-14): Added `EXECUTION_MODE.txt` run contract with `PLANNING_ONLY` default and gated post-gate execution prompt generation and downstream fan-out to `EXECUTION_ENABLED` runs only.
- v4.4 (2026-02-12): Added deterministic skill-invocation contract for critical gates and added required post-I2 PASS plus human GO execution-prompt generation using `EXECUTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`.
- v4.3 (2026-02-11): Added mandatory pre-run knowledge-lint contract with required run artifact (`KNOWLEDGE_LINT.txt`) and Stage A entry criterion wiring.
- v4.2 (2026-02-10): Aligned Stage H/I/I2 envelope artifact references to `<SPRINT_ID>_ENVELOPE*.md` to avoid `SPRINT_SPRINT_*` naming drift.
- v4.1 (2026-02-09): Added cross-run memory contract: only `SCRATCHPAD.md` `Active Pitfalls` is mandatory pre-run memory; run narratives are run-local in `runs/<RUN_ID>/RETRO.md` and optional.
- v4.0 (2026-02-08): Reordered `STAGE_J` before `STAGE_I2`, resolving the checklist dependency, and added execution prompt generation as the recommended post-pipeline step.

## Global rules (HARD)
- No stage may start unless its entry criteria pass.
- No stage may complete unless its exit criteria pass.
- Pre-run knowledge lint MUST pass (`bash scripts/knowledge_lint.sh`) before `STAGE_A` starts, and output MUST be persisted at `docs/Factory/runs/<RUN_ID>/KNOWLEDGE_LINT.txt`.
- If the run is advancing a unit inside an already-authorized mission, pre-run mission lint MUST pass (`bash scripts/mission_lint.sh <MISSION_ID>`) before `STAGE_A` starts, and output MUST be persisted at `docs/Factory/runs/<RUN_ID>/MISSION_LINT.txt`.
- If the optional Codex Mission Goal Continuity adapter is enabled, mission cursor lint MUST pass (`bash scripts/mission_cursor_lint.sh <MISSION_ID>`) before an agent continues from `MISSION_CURSOR.json` or an external goal/bookmark. This check is additive and does not replace `mission_lint.sh`.
- Every stage produces `pack/HANDOFF/HANDOFF_STAGE_<STAGE_CODE>.md` containing:
  - outputs produced
  - changes made
  - assumptions
  - open issues (`BLOCKING` and `NON-BLOCKING`)
  - verification steps recommended
  - exit criteria PASS or FAIL
  - iteration metadata when applicable
- After each stage writes its handoff, run `./scripts/factoryctl stage-lint --run <RUN_ID> --stage <STAGE_CODE>`. If stage-lint fails, do not advance to the next stage until the handoff or expected stage output is fixed.
- Handoff size caps and change log format are enforced per `DEFINITIONS.md`.
- For critical gate stages (`STAGE_D`, `STAGE_J`, `STAGE_I2`), stage prompts MUST include deterministic skill invocation when a relevant skill exists:
  - `Use the <skill name> skill.`
  - If no relevant skill exists, prompts MUST declare that explicitly and proceed via the stage contract only.
- Run execution mode defaults to `PLANNING_ONLY` and MUST be persisted in run-root `EXECUTION_MODE.txt`.
- Factory-controlled code-changing runs MUST apply SIMPLE-CODE-GATE v2 from root `AGENTS.md`: smallest clear behavior-preserving change, no code bloat, no spooky action, no dependency creep, no silent failures, and no awkward or speculative abstractions.
- `EXECUTION_PROMPT.md` generation and downstream run fan-out are forbidden unless `EXECUTION_MODE.txt` is `EXECUTION_ENABLED`.
- Mission Mode, if enabled, is additive and MUST NOT alter per-unit stage entry and exit criteria, authorization contracts, or iteration caps.

## Iteration metadata (HARD)
Stages that can run in cycles MUST declare:
- `Iteration: k of max N` (`N = 2` unless explicitly stated otherwise)

Cycle stages:
- `STAGE_B`
- `STAGE_C`
- `STAGE_I`

## Context loading rule (HARD)
Each stage’s inputs must:
- exist on disk
- be loaded into the agent’s working context if marked `LOAD`

Stage inputs are labelled:
- `LOAD`: must be read and summarized before writing outputs
- `DISK`: must exist; may be consulted as needed

## Context recall rule (HARD)
- `STAGE_A` may not start until `docs/Factory/runs/<RUN_ID>/CONTEXT_RECALL_REPORT.md` exists and was generated from the artifact recall index via `./scripts/factoryctl context-report --profile stage-a`.
- A generated Stage A report with `Coverage Verdict: WEAK` remains blocking unless it has an explicit direct-source repair addendum with `Final Repaired Verdict: REPAIRED_DIRECT_SOURCE_CHECK`.
- Direct-source repair is allowed only after context-index refresh and fallback-scope attempts, only for concrete local files, code paths, or exact artifacts that are read directly from disk, and only when source summaries and exact file paths are recorded in the report.
- Direct-source repair is forbidden for missing sources, unreadable sources, human decisions or approvals, external sources, ambiguous artifacts, or unresolved refs that remain material to Stage A intent.
- A repaired report is not treated as raw `WEAK`; an unrepaired report containing `Coverage Verdict: WEAK` is still a hard halt.
- Mission checkpointing and downstream mission-unit planning may not proceed until `docs/Factory/missions/<MISSION_ID>/MISSION_CONTEXT_RECALL_REPORT.md` exists and was generated via `./scripts/factoryctl context-report --profile mission-checkpoint`.
- PO sprint brief drafting and review must follow the PO process recall contract in `docs/Factory/ProductOwner/PO_PROCESS.md`; Factory stage execution assumes that upstream brief-cycle recall evidence already exists when the raw brief originated from the PO lane.
- Context recall artifacts are evidence aids, not authority. Source artifacts remain canonical.

## Cross-run memory rule (HARD)
- Mandatory pre-run cross-run memory is limited to `docs/Factory/SCRATCHPAD.md` `## Active Pitfalls (Mandatory)`.
- Per-run retrospectives live in `docs/Factory/runs/<RUN_ID>/RETRO.md` and are optional context unless explicitly required by a stage brief.

## Run structure (HARD)
A run produces:
- `docs/Factory/runs/<RUN_ID>/raw_brief.md`
- `docs/Factory/runs/<RUN_ID>/RETRO.md`
- `docs/Factory/runs/<RUN_ID>/KNOWLEDGE_LINT.txt`
- `docs/Factory/runs/<RUN_ID>/CONTEXT_RECALL_REPORT.md`
- `docs/Factory/runs/<RUN_ID>/EXECUTION_MODE.txt`
- `docs/Factory/runs/<RUN_ID>/SPRINT_ID.txt`
- `docs/Factory/runs/<RUN_ID>/pack/`
- `docs/Factory/runs/<RUN_ID>/EXECUTION_PROMPT.md` (required only when `EXECUTION_MODE.txt = EXECUTION_ENABLED` after `STAGE_I2` PASS plus human GO)

If Mission Mode is enabled, mission root additionally produces:
- `docs/Factory/missions/<MISSION_ID>/MISSION_MANIFEST.md`
- `docs/Factory/missions/<MISSION_ID>/MISSION_CONTEXT_RECALL_REPORT.md`
- `docs/Factory/missions/<MISSION_ID>/MISSION_CHECKPOINT.md`
- `docs/Factory/missions/<MISSION_ID>/MISSION_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`
- `docs/Factory/missions/<MISSION_ID>/MISSION_EXECUTION_PROMPT.md` (optional)
- `docs/Factory/missions/<MISSION_ID>/MISSION_CURSOR.json` (optional derived resume cursor for Codex Mission Goal Continuity adapter)

If the run is advancing a unit inside an already-authorized mission, run root additionally produces:
- `docs/Factory/runs/<RUN_ID>/MISSION_LINT.txt`

## Dependency graph (authoritative)
- `STAGE_A` produces `intent.md`
- `STAGE_B` consumes `intent.md` and produces `intent_redteam.md`
- `STAGE_C` consumes `intent.md` and `intent_redteam.md`, updates `intent.md`, and produces `intent_synthesis.md`
- `STAGE_D` consumes intent docs and produces `intent_lock_report.md`
- `STAGE_E` consumes locked `intent.md` and produces `premortem.md` and `risk_register.md`
- `STAGE_F` consumes locked `intent.md` and `risk_register.md` and produces `fixtures/`, `verification_plan.md`, `traceability_matrix.md`, and optional `verification_manifest.yaml`
- `STAGE_G` consumes `intent.md`, `risk_register.md`, and `verification_plan.md` and produces `micro_sprints.md`
- `STAGE_H` consumes `intent.md`, `micro_sprints.md`, and `verification_plan.md` and produces `<SPRINT_ID>_ENVELOPE.md` and `SPRINT_ID.txt`
- `STAGE_I` consumes the envelope and verification assets and produces the envelope red-team report plus any hardened revisions
- `STAGE_J` consumes the full pack and produces `PACK_MANIFEST.md` and `PACK_CHECKLIST.md`
- `STAGE_I2` consumes the full pack plus `PACK_CHECKLIST.md` and `PACK_MANIFEST.md` and produces `PACK_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
- Mission Mode consumes one or more completed sprint packs and applies a mission-level checkpoint before chained execution

## STAGE_VALIDATION — Stage Lint
Purpose:
- deterministically validate one stage handoff and its expected outputs immediately after that stage completes
- catch malformed handoffs, unresolved placeholders, missing iteration metadata, missing stage outputs, and handoff word-cap drift before later stages build on them

Command:
- `./scripts/factoryctl stage-lint --run <RUN_ID> --stage <STAGE_CODE>`

Exit criteria:
- `stage_lint: PASS`
- if stage-lint returns FAIL, fix the stage handoff or expected output before advancing

Authority:
- stage-lint is a deterministic evidence check; it does not replace Red, Blue, Purple, or human judgment

## Intent Unlock Protocol (HARD)
If any downstream stage discovers the locked intent is flawed:
- unlock requires Purple plus human approval
- a new `intent.md` version must be created with an updated change log
- downstream stages `E` through `J` must be re-run or re-validated against the updated intent

- verdict recorded: PASS, CONDITIONAL PASS, or FAIL
- no PASS or CONDITIONAL PASS allowed if any `[SCOPE EXPANSION]` remains unapproved
- `PACK_MANIFEST.md` updated to mark `PACK_AUDIT_REPORT.md` as present and non-empty

## POST_I2_VALIDATION — Pack Lint
Purpose:
- run deterministic validation over the completed planning pack before human Go or No-go review

Command:
- `./scripts/factoryctl pack-lint --run <RUN_ID>`

Checks include:
- required run-root and pack files exist and are non-empty
- expected handoffs exist
- no unresolved placeholders remain
- word caps are satisfied
- checklist critical items are `YES`
- audit verdict is not `FAIL`
- execution-mode evidence is internally consistent

Exit criteria:
- `pack-lint` returns PASS before the pack is presented for human execution review
- if `pack-lint` returns FAIL, defects are fixed in the pack and affected stage handoffs are updated

## POST_GATE — Execution Prompt Generation (execution-enabled runs only)
Skip rule:
- if `EXECUTION_MODE.txt = PLANNING_ONLY`, this stage is skipped and the run terminates at planning-pack completion

Entry criteria:
- `STAGE_I2` verdict is PASS
- human review decision is explicit Go
- `EXECUTION_MODE.txt` equals `EXECUTION_ENABLED`

Inputs:
- `LOAD`: `pack/<SPRINT_ID>_ENVELOPE.md`, `pack/micro_sprints.md`, `pack/verification_plan.md`, `pack/traceability_matrix.md`
- `DISK`: `pack/intent.md`, `pack/risk_register.md`, `pack/PACK_AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `docs/Factory/SCRATCHPAD.md`

Outputs:
- `EXECUTION_PROMPT.md`

Exit criteria:
- prompt is instantiated from `docs/Factory/templates/EXECUTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`
- prompt has no unresolved placeholders
- prompt includes deterministic skill routing instructions and stage-aligned guardrails
- for code-changing execution, prompt includes SIMPLE-CODE-GATE v2 and an exit-checklist item for accepted complexity

## MISSION_WRAPPER (additive, optional — not a replacement stage chain)
Purpose:
- wrap multiple completed sprint packs into one mission execution sequence under one consolidated checkpoint

Mission inputs:
- `DISK`: referenced sprint run roots and packs
- `DISK`: `docs/Factory/MISSION_MODE.md`
- `LOAD`: mission manifest, mission context recall report, checkpoint, and completion artifacts

Mission outputs:
- `docs/Factory/missions/<MISSION_ID>/MISSION_MANIFEST.md`
- `docs/Factory/missions/<MISSION_ID>/MISSION_CONTEXT_RECALL_REPORT.md`
- `docs/Factory/missions/<MISSION_ID>/MISSION_CHECKPOINT.md`
- `docs/Factory/missions/<MISSION_ID>/MISSION_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`

Mission hard rules:
1. Mission does not bypass per-unit `A -> I2` contracts
2. per-unit iteration caps remain unchanged
3. mission checkpoint must record one explicit GO or NO-GO decision
4. any policy, scope, or verification breach in a unit halts the mission
5. remaining units after halt are marked skipped until restart authorization
6. `MISSION_MANIFEST.md` remains the authored ledger of record
7. if a unit run is advancing an already-authorized mission, pre-run mission lint must pass before `STAGE_A` begins

Mission restart rule:
- resume from a failed unit only if mission scope ledger, prior evidence integrity, and mission checkpoint authorization remain valid
