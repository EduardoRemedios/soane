# Sprint Brief Review Checklist

## Version
v1.1

## Change Log
- v1.1 (2026-05-09): Added expected proof-shape quality check for left-shifted verification.
- v1.0 (2026-03-21): Generic starter-kit checklist for the PO-authored sprint brief Purple Gate, including mandatory brief-cycle recall evidence.

## Purpose

This checklist is evaluated by the Purple Gate after a PO-authored sprint brief has been through one Red/Blue cycle. Answer YES or NO for each item.

## Critical (must all be YES for PASS)

C1. Brief scope is within the locked Phase Intent boundaries.
C2. Brief does not introduce requirements outside Phase Intent scope without tagging them `[SCOPE EXPANSION]` plus BLOCKING.
C3. Hard constraints from the Phase Intent are preserved.
C4. Acceptance criteria are binary, not vague.
C5. Sprint budget has not been exceeded.
C6. Brief references current project state accurately, supported by the current brief-cycle context recall report.
C7. Phase Intent reference is explicit.
C8. Prior Red Team objections, accepted descopes, and binding trade-offs relevant to this brief were surfaced in the brief-cycle context recall report and handled explicitly.

## Quality (can be NO, but must be explained)

Q1. Out-of-scope section is explicit and non-empty.
Q2. Domain context is present where relevant.
Q3. Requirements tagged `[PO_INFERRED]` are reasonable domain inferences, not scope expansion in disguise.
Q4. Requirements tagged for human compliance review are clearly marked.
Q5. The brief builds logically on previous sprint outcomes within the phase, if it is not the first sprint.
Q6. The brief includes expected proof shape where useful: likely tests, fixtures, no-touch paths, and must-fail-closed cases.
