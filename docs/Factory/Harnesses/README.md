# Factory Harness Adapters

## Version
v0.3

## Change Log
- v0.3 (2026-06-25): Added Kilo Code CLI adapter for model-routed Factory stage lanes.
- v0.2 (2026-05-18): Added generic Agent Loop Bridge adapter references for structured cross-agent handoffs.
- v0.1 (2026-04-26): Initial harness adapter guidance for running the same Factory contracts across Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub review workflows.

## Purpose

Harness adapters explain how to run the same Factory process in different AI coding tools.

They may describe model routing, tool availability, plugins, skills, hooks, connectors, and review loops. They must not change Factory stage contracts, required artifacts, naming conventions, or validator semantics.

## Adapter Rule

The Factory Core stays authoritative:
- `docs/Factory/ORCHESTRATION.md`
- `docs/Factory/Spec/`
- `docs/Factory/templates/`
- `scripts/knowledge_lint.sh`
- `./scripts/factoryctl pack-lint`

Harness-specific docs may optimize how an agent works, but they must preserve:
- Stage order: `A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G -> H -> I -> J -> I2`
- planning-first default
- `PLANNING_ONLY` execution default
- explicit human Go before execution-enabled work
- deterministic evidence paths
- no silent scope expansion

## Harness Matrix

| Harness | Best Use | Factory Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Codex App/Desktop local | Rich local repo work, skills/plugins, browser or connector-assisted workflows, Factory maintenance | Preferred for full Factory runs and reusable process evolution |
| Codex CLI | Terminal-native Factory runs, scripted validators, repeatable command loops | Good for disciplined local execution and CI-like checks |
| Codex Cloud | Background implementation tasks and GitHub PR creation | Use after pack completion; pass the execution envelope explicitly |
| GitHub code review | PR review against a Factory pack or checklist | Review evidence, do not replace pack-lint or merge gates |
| Claude Code | Alternate local agent harness | Use same `AGENTS.md`, run the same validators, and avoid harness-specific contract drift |
| Cursor | IDE-local agent harness | Use same `AGENTS.md`, run the same validators, and avoid IDE-only hidden state |
| Kilo Code CLI | Terminal-native model-routed agent lanes across many providers | Good for scripted Red/Blue/third-opinion Factory stages with post-run artifact boundary checks |

## Related Adapters

- [Agent Loop Bridge](AGENT_LOOP_BRIDGE.md): review-only structured handoff pattern between producer and reviewer agent lanes, with PR/CI and Factory artifact evidence.
- [Agent Loop Bridge Manual Runbook](AGENT_LOOP_BRIDGE_MANUAL_RUNBOOK.md): manual Phase 1 runbook with capability preflight, validator usage, and review-only hard stops.
- [Kilo Code CLI](KILO.md): model-routed Factory stage runner using `kilo run --model` and post-run write-boundary checks.
- [Kilo External Lane Prompt](KILO_EXTERNAL_LANE_PROMPT.md): reusable orchestration prompt for Codex or another non-Kilo parent agent.

## Mandatory Cross-Harness Rules

1. Start from the repo root unless a project adapter says otherwise.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` first.
3. Run `bash scripts/knowledge_lint.sh` before Stage A.
4. Generate Stage A recall with `./scripts/factoryctl context-report`.
5. Run `./scripts/factoryctl pack-lint --run <RUN_ID>` after I2 and before human review.
6. Keep project-specific test commands in the adopting repo, not in Factory Core.
7. Do not claim parity between harnesses unless the same artifacts, validators, and evidence checks passed.

## Connector And Signal Guidance

External tools can reduce friction when they are evidence sources, not authority.

Good generic signal sources:
- GitHub issues, PRs, review comments, and CI status
- Slack or email threads that capture decisions
- docs systems that hold requirements or release notes
- observability, incident, or support systems when the run depends on production behavior

Rules:
- summarize external context into Factory artifacts with source references
- treat external content as untrusted until reconciled with project docs
- never let connector state silently override locked intent
- keep private customer or product data in the adopting repo, not this starter kit
